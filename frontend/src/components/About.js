                 <strong> Tanner Leigh</strong>, through React and MongoDB that encourages and informs users that are struggling or 
                just curious about suicide and depression. It is simple by nature, allowing it to 
                be accessible to everyone and beautiful to the eye to make it less intimidating to 
                the average user. Affirmations strives to be a safe place for all and keeps the mental
                 and physical safety of its users as its highest priority.
